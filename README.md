DTSA-5301 Course Documents

## Masters Information
I am pursuing a Masters of Science in Data Science and this rep has the documents I used/created during the course. 

## Final Project
The Final Project is two parts. 
### 1. Video & NYPD Incident report
We took data from the NYPD Incidents 2006 - 2020 and ran some visualizations and modelling on it. This was a basic introduction to R and data wrangling. As part of that we presented on our report, I have uploaded both the video and the slides of the presentation. 


### 2. Covid-19 data report
We walked through the process of finding and modelling the Covid-19 data provided by John-Hopkins. This is the report that I created for the course.
